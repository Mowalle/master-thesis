In contrast, current AR applications require the use of unwieldy equipment which discourages their use. In order to essentially ease the perception of digital information and to naturally interact with the pervasive computing landscape, the required AR equipment has to be seamlessly integrated into the user's natural environment. Considering this basic principle, this paper proposes the car as an AR apparatus and presents an innovative visualization paradigm for navigation systems that is anticipated to enhance user interaction.},
