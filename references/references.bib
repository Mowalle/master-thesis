	abstract = {The augmented reality (AR) research community has been developing a manifold of ideas and concepts to improve the depiction of virtual objects in a real scene. In contrast, current AR applications require the use of unwieldy equipment which discourages their use. In order to essentially ease the perception of digital information and to naturally interact with the pervasive computing landscape, the required AR equipment has to be seamlessly integrated into the user's natural environment. Considering this basic principle, this paper proposes the car as an AR apparatus and presents an innovative visualization paradigm for navigation systems that is anticipated to enhance user interaction.},

We recreated an interactive table in virtual reality using the same software used for the hardware table and conducted a user study to compare the two systems. Users were able to complete all tasks on both systems and results show little difference regarding preference between the two systems. While only a few of the advantages of virtual reality were taken advantage of, the results are promising for virtual display environments in general.},

These technologies are being combined with virtual reality (VR) headsets to produce immersive VR experiences that respond more naturally to user actions. In this research, we explore gesture-based interaction in immersive VR games by using the Unity game engine, the LeapMotion sensor, a laptop, a smartphone, and the Freefly VR headset. By avoiding Android deployment, this novel setup allowed for fast prototyping and testing of different ideas for immersive VR interaction, at an affordable cost. We implemented a system that allows users to play a game in a virtual world and compared placements of the leap motion sensor on the desk and on the headset. In this experimental setup, users interacted with a numeric dial panel and then played a Tetris game inside the VR environment by pressing the buttons of a virtual panel. The results suggest that, although the tracking quality of the Leap Motion sensor was rather limited when used in the head-mounted setup for pointing and selection tasks, its performance was much better in the desk-mounted setup, providing a novel platform for research and rapid application development.},

	abstract = {One of the major opportunities of Augmented Reality (AR) is supporting drivers in wayfinding. In order to correctly display AR visualisations in the environment, accurate global localisation as well as precise mapping of the environment is necessary. As a first step we assessed the positioning error of current Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) sensors and found that the accuracy of current GNSS sensors is not high enough to correctly position AR visualisations at intersections. Based on these results, we developed a novel visualisation which does not require precise localisation and still provides drivers with the impression that it is part of their environment. We implemented this novel visualisation along with a traditional AR visualisation in a car prototype in order to compare them in a user study. Overall, the novel visualisation was preferred over the traditional visualisation without adding additional workload on drivers or decreasing the usability of the visualisation.},

@article{Virtanen2015,
	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) maps have many potential applications, such as navigation and urban planning. In this article, we present the use of a 3D virtual world platform Meshmoon to create intelligent open data 3D maps. A processing method is developed to enable the generation of 3D virtual environments from the open data of the National Land Survey of Finland. The article combines the elements needed in contemporary smart city concepts, such as the connection between attribute information and 3D objects, and the creation of collaborative virtual worlds from open data. By using our 3D virtual world platform, it is possible to create up-to-date, collaborative 3D virtual models, which are automatically updated on all viewers. In the scenes, all users are able to interact with the model, and with each other. With the developed processing methods, the creation of virtual world scenes was partially automated for collaboration activities.},

@article{Tully2015,
	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the use of games technologies for the research and the development of 3D representations of real environments captured from GIS information and open source map data. Challenges involved in this area concern the large data-sets to be dealt with. Some existing map data include errors and are not complete, which makes the generation of realistic and accurate 3D environments problematic. The domain of application of our work is crisis management which requires very accurate GIS or map information. We believe the use of creating a 3D virtual environment using real map data whilst correcting and completing the missing data, improves the quality and performance of crisis management decision support system to provide a more natural and intuitive interface for crisis managers. Consequently, we present a case study into issues related to combining multiple large datasets to create an accurate representation of a novel, multi-layered, hybrid real-world maps. The hybrid map generation combines LiDAR, Ordnance Survey, and OpenStreetMap data to generate 3D cities spanning 1 km2. Evaluation of initial visualised scenes is presented. Initial tests consist of a 1 km2 landscape map containing up to 16 million vertices’ and run at an optimal 51.66 frames per-second.},

@article{Reichenbacher2001,
	abstract = {GISs are moving away from a system for experts to a more widely-used tool for answering spatial-related questions. The dawn of new technologies on the horizon, such as telecommunication, mobile Internet, and handheld computing devices, offers new chances to the everyday use of geoinformation. However, the existing approaches to mobile visualisation of geoinformation mostly have a commercial background and are rather technology-centred. This quite narrow view ignores many relevant problems and does not fully profit from the new possibilities a mobile cartography could provide. Taking the existing problems into account the paper sketches a general conceptual framework for geoinformation use in a mobile environment. Specific user tasks and requests in a mobile environment are identified, which is followed by an outline of possible methods to personalise a GIS for better mobile assistance. Putting emphasis on the importance of analytical functions for mobile cartography, the process of adaptive and dynamic generation of visualisations for mobile users on the basis of vector data (e.g. SVG) is illustrated and the key research fields involved are pointed out.},

@article{Vanclooster2016,
	abstract = {Abstract In light of the many improvements within 3D urban modeling and Location-Based Services, this article provides a timely review of the state-of-the-art on integrating indoor and outdoor spaces in pedestrian navigation guidance aids. With people moving seamlessly between buildings and surrounding areas, navigation guidance tools should extend from merely outdoor or indoor guidance, to provide support in the combined indoor-outdoor context. This article first examines the challenges and complexities of integrating indoor and outdoor spaces into a single navigation system. Next, by using objective selection criteria, 36 relevant studies were withheld and further reviewed on their specific developments in data model requirements, and algorithmic and context support for integrated IO navigation systems. This review shows that the challenges of dealing with both indoor and outdoor space structures, while taking into account pedestrian's freer use of space, currently complicate the proposition of a unified IO space concept for navigation. However, there are some ongoing developments (e.g. context definitions, algorithmic extensions, increased data availability, growing awareness of pedestrians’ perception during wayfinding) that will help to bring outdoor and indoor spaces closer together in the realm of combined geospatial analysis.},
